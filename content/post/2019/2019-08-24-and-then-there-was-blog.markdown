It’s not like I woke up one morning and decided, “Gee golly, I’m going to create a blog today.”

<!--more-->

That’s not how it happened, and not just because my internal monologue never uses the phrase “gee golly.” No, it took many mornings of waking up saying “today is the day.” Also, many nights of “right after I watch this episode of Rick and Morty for the third time.” Oh, and don’t forget all the afternoons of “you know a nap would pair much better with that burrito than writing.” The important thing is I’m here now and I’m pretty sure a 3-year domain name registration fee is non-refundable.

## Don't Call Me Ishmael {#whoami}

I’m not sure which came first: the engineering mindset or being an engineer. Either way, engineering suits me. Potentially dangerous (and irritating to my friends) side effects come with this affliction:

<span></span>

* A pathological need to quantify. 
* A pathological need to tinker.
* A pathological need to have at least three things in a list

Ok, so maybe the last one isn’t endemic to all engineers, but after you’ve been subjected to three semesters of thermodynamics, you’re bound to develop at least one neurosis. But I digress...

Having mastered chemical engineering always being the coding guy in group projects, data science and analytics were a pretty easy transition. After all what is data science more than quantifying the world and coding is the ultimate form of tinkering. This is not to mention accelerating time in simulations and predictions is much easier than in a cellular processes.

As I write this, I work for a major biopharmaceutical company having moved through a wide range of roles spanning preclinical PK/PD modeling, product commercialization, operations technical support, procurement, distribution technology, and a sprinkle of commercial exposure for good measure. If you’re really curious or really bored, my LinkedIn profile (if that’s still a thing at the time you read this) is linked in the menu bar. Currently, I work in a group named “Digital Proactive Process Analytics” which seeks to leverage the company’s manufacturing data to automate reporting, accelerate investigations, and facilitate process optimization. Basically we create a bunch of Shiny Apps and analysis scripts with manufacturing data. We also dabble in data modeling, particularly with NoSQL databases. So yeah, graph databases are going to be a thing here. 

## Another Brick in the Wall? {#another}

So why does the world need another R/data science blog? Maybe it doesn't. Of course, I know I only paid the first ten or so people to read this article so it seems like at least one person is intrigued. All snarkicism aside, to me, that justifies this blog’s existence.

Look, for anybody who has been a part of the R and open source community for any length of time, you probably realize just how great and generous it is. I wouldn’t be where I am now if not for the contributions of the community. Even for my modest accomplishments to date, I know I both stand on the shoulders of giants and walk the thousand bridges of man. If I can give back by helping a single person learning a single trick from a single post, then it seems worth it. Bonus points if I end up helping future Marcus remember the difference between `spread` and `gather` (or reminding him that this will be moot with a future CRAN release of [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html)).  

## What to Expect {#expectations}

There will be R. There will be database and data structure stuff. But above all, there will be a lot of Simpsons and 30 Rock references.

I'm not holding myself to any regular frequency, but I would like to post something at least every few weeks. I plan to essentially take inspiration from what I'm working on at the time. There is this impending sense of doom, though, that I'll run out of things to write about...despite already having a very long list of ideas (writing down topic ideas was much easier than actually writing a post).

Ok, enough prologue. Let's do this thing. 

## TLDR {#TLDR}
